  I'm an  <i class="fas fa-fish" style="color:#33B5FF;"></i> Aquatic Biology <i class="fas fa-fish" style="color:#33B5FF;"></i>  major within the EEMB department at UCSB. During the school year you can find me working in the REEF down on campus point. I am a research intern in the Culver Lab at the Marine Science Institute, working on rock scallop aquaculture. I am interested in figuring out how we can utilize native species in a hatchery setting.
